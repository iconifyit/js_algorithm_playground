# js_algorithm_playground
## Experiments with Javascript algorithms to help me improve my understanding and abililty to write them.

Nothing very exciting here, but I hope to add cool ways to do things fast, as I go about learning new things in the course I'm taking on Coursera.com.

I've created a JSPerf for one of the algorithms I'm playing with here, Merge Sort (with inversion count as a side bonus :)
