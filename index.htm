# Stacey Reiman's JavaScript Algorithm Playground
## Experiments with Javascript algorithms to help me improve my understanding and abililty to write them.

Our new social media site and app [Kwippe](http://www.kwippe.com) runs a lot of different algorithms to combine body parts and create fun images, so I've been on a quest to improve my ability to write them. 

Nothing very exciting or original here yet, but I hope to add cool ways to do things fast, as I go about learning new things in the course I'm taking on Coursera.com.

I've created a JSPerf for one of the algorithms I'm playing with here, Merge Sort (with inversion count as a side bonus :)

[The JSPerf is here.](http://jsperf.com/updated-merge-sort-inversion-count-test/5)

As we've moved on to Quicksort - I've added to an existing JSPerf and the results are pretty cool! Using a little bubble sort you can find the median pivot, which I've read is much better than using a random or first element. [Check it out here.](http://jsperf.com/javascript-quicksort-comparisons/3)

I added a Flashsort sample to the Quicksort perf and it won, caramba! Now the thing is re-te-complicado.... not exactly intuitive like Quicksort. But I'd like to have some fun deciphering it :)
